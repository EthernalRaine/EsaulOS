# Concept of Components

Components are Groups, with groups having owners, collectively pooling similar components.
Ideally each component has its own Owner, who is responsible for it, however this is not always the case since this we're not a company.

A list of the current components (and owners, if applicable) include:
* core (EthernalRaine) - Essential OS compontent group
* com (EthernalRaine) - Any kind of user input communication
* docs (EthernalRaine) - Documentation, self-explanitory
* build (seal331) - Toolchain and Build System
